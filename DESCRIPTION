Description: BayesGGM is a R package to estimate Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) using 6 different Bayesian estimation methods.
  Researchers can choose between 1) a Bayesian GLASSO, 2) an Adaptive Bayesian GLASSO, 3) a Graphical Horseshoe, 4)
  a (Ridge-type) penalized estimator based on an Eigenvalue decompostion of the Wishart prior, 5) an adaptive (Ridge-type) penalized estimator based on an
  Eigenvalue decomposition of the Wishart prior, and 6) a normal Wishart prior with no regularization.
  In addition, BayesGGM also provide 95\% Credibility Intervals for the strength, closeness, and betweenness centrality, and imputes missing data.
